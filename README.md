Molly is a Dog
========

Molly is the name of our dog, so naturally #mollydog evolved as her social media hashtag.
<b>LITTLE DID I KNOW..</b>
That "Molly" is in fact an extremely popular dog name. So, this simple javascript app is a tribute to Molly and her similarly-named canine friends. 

<h3>This app was designed to accomplish the following:</h3>
<ul>
	<li> Access and retrieve data from a public API--in this case <a href="https://instagram.com/developer/">Instagram</a></li>
	<li> Display the data on the page using only native JavaScript</li>
	<li> Enable the UI to be updated without a page refresh</li>
</ul>
